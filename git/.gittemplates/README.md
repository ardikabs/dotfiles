# GIT Commit
A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete
the following sentence:<br>
```
    * If applied, this commit <will your subject line here>
```

## Structure:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s]
```

### Type
Must be one of the following:
* ci - Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: GitLabCI, GitHub Actions, TravisCI, CircleCI)
* build - Changes that affect the build system or ternal dependencies
* chore - Changes that affect the build process or xiliary tool changes
* docs - Documentation only changes
* feat - A new feature
* fix - A bug fix
* perf - A code change that improves performance
* refactor - A code change that neither fixes a bug or ds a feature
* revert - Reverting things
* style - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the de (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* test - Adding missing tests or correcting existing (stests

### Subject
The subject contains a succint description of the change:
* Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* No dot (.) at the end.

### Scope
* A scope may be provided to a commitâ€™s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g.<br>
`feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays.`

### Body
* Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: **"change"** not "changed" nor "changes".
* The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer
* BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer **BREAKING CHANGE:**,
* Or appends a **!** after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning).
* A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
